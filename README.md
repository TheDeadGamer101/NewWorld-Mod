# NewWorld-Mod
This is a mod that adds a few new ores and a new faction or so. Right now i have added about 40% of the new faction and 2 of the four ores.


## What has it got:
* 2 spored ground unit trees.
* A simple unit tree.
* 1 air tree.

## What's planned
I have planned to have a full faction of spored creatures with 3 ground trees, 3 air trees and a see tree.
Some terrain pieces for spored objects. 
I'd like to have some spored defences and turrets too.

What I plan to work on is a warp gate that's similar to NewHorizon's(https://github.com/Yuria-Shikibe/NewHorizonMod) one.
